# VPlayer

Thank you for choosing VPlayer 2.0, currently the 2.0 version DOES NOT WORK Well and is in VERY ALPHA STAGE, Please DO NOT use version 2.0 in public worlds as it will break all the time, please use the current released version (1.3.*).

VPplayer is only for SDK V2 and can not be used with SDK V3 (Udon).

**VERSION 2.0 IS IN IT'S VERY EARLY STAGES AND WILL BREAK**
##### Vplayer 2.0 is a complete remake on the original and will have the following features once finished:

- Master only control.
- Toggle allowing others (non-Master) to enter links.
- Toggle allowing others (non-Master) to control the player.
- Full set of player control buttons.
- Local volume slider.
- separate Music Only Player (No video support).
- Stream player.
- 3D Support.
- Toggleable screen emission.

##### How To Use:
Download it and put it into Unity, it should work, if not then open up an ticket.

###### No videos are playing?:
Ensure you YouTube-DL is upto date, this is the cause of 99% of video player issues in Unity, Also try a other video, for what I can see YouTube does not allow you to play video which are blocked or copyright claimed sometimes.

###### My YouTube-DL is up to date but I still having issues, what can I do?:
Open up an issue and I will try to help you :)

Feel free to use it in your VRChat worlds, please do not get rid of the credit for MunifiSense.
