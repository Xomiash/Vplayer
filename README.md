# VPlayer

Thank you for choosing VPlayer, is a video player for VRchat which is based off MunifiSense Hangout-Player: https://github.com/MunifiSense/Hangout-Player (Mainly used in my worlds) This is only for VRChat and can't be used anywhere else.

VPplayer is only for SDK V2 and can not be used with SDK V3 (Udon).

**PLEASE NOTE VPLAYER WILL BE RE-DONE SOON TO ALLOW MORE FEATURES IN VERSION 2.0**
##### Vplayer is a much more simplified version of Hangout-Player and only has the following features:

- Master only control.
- Toggle allowing others (non-Master) to enter links.
- Toggle allowing others (non-Master) to control the player.
- Full set of player control buttons.
- Local volume slider.
- separate Music Only Player (No video support).

##### If you want more features like:

- Toggle between old (VRCSyncVideo) and new (VRCSyncVideoStream) player.
- 3D Support.
- Toggleable screen emission.

##### And much more please check out MunifiSense Hangout-Player: https://github.com/MunifiSense/Hangout-Player 

##### How To Use:
Just download the latest release, open it up in Unity and plop the Vplayer prefab down, it should just work.
